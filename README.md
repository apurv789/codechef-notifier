# Codechef-Notifier

This extension removes the extra effort of checking the submission page to know the verdict of submissions made on codechef.<br>
This extension does all that hard work for you. When the verdict is available, this extension will inform the user using desktop notifications so that the user can check the detailed status of their submission.
